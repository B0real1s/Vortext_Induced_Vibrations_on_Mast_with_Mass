CONCLUSION

The amplitude of vibrations at the critical wind speed is very large (1.1m) even though we have relatively light
wind speed (6.9m/s ≈ 15mph).

But in stronger wind (13.8m/s ≈ 30mph) the amplitude of vibrations is comperatively very small (15mm) , despite the 
force being 4 times stronger.

This is because the first case hits resonanse frequency
& because of the damoing ratio
